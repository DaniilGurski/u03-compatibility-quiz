Same Wave is a game for anyone curious about compatibility. For life's big, small, deep, and delightfully weird questions!

## How to Play
Same Wave is a two-player game where you discover if you think alike on various topics. Both players share one device and take turns answering questions privately.

### Game flow

1. **Choose a category** - Pick something you're both into (or think you are)
2. **Take turns answering** - Tap "Agree", "Disagree", or "Neutral" - no overthinking!
3. **Pass the device** - Hand off between rounds (trust us, it's part of the fun)
4. **See your results** - Find out if you're on the same wavelength
